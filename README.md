## About the Project

This project focuses on detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using digital image processing techniques. Early detection of pneumonia can significantly improve patient outcomes, and this project aims to assist healthcare professionals in this regard.

## Dataset

We utilize publicly available datasets containing labeled chest X-ray images, distinguishing between pneumonia and non-pneumonia cases.
